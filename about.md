  If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll
  probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy
  childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all
  before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap,
  but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the
  truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the
  second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages
  apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They’re
  quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father.
  They’re nice and all —I’m not saying that—but they’re also touchy as hell.

I'm Enrique, software developer based in <strike>Spain</strike>, Germany,
and currently <strike>Java</strike>, <strike>PHP</strike>, <strike>Python</strike>,
JavaScript pays my bills.

This blog should work fine, except in terms of success.

I usually spend my spare time reading, relocating to yet another city, watching movies,
hanging out, running, and working on [personal projects](/projects).
If you want to contact me just send me a message to `enrmarc@gmail.com`.
I also use that handle in sites like [GitHub](http://github.com/enrmarc)
and [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/434171/enrique-marcos?tab=profile). More info
on my [CV](http://enrmarc.github.io/data/resume.pdf).
