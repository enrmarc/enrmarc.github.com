<div class="author-note">
  If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll
  probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy
  childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all
  before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap,
  but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the
  truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the
  second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages
  apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They’re
  quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father.
  They’re nice and all —I’m not saying that—but they’re also touchy as hell.

I'm Enrique, software developer based in Spain and currently <strike>Android</strike>, <strike>PHP</strike>, <strike>Ruby</strike>, JavaScript pays my bills. Ideally, this site should contain a collection of curated,
beautifully written, inspiring, and interesting posts, but in terms of writing I'm
just a <em>dilettante</em>.

Apart from working and writing about technical stuff, I spend my spare time
reading, watching movies, drawing, running, and improving my guitar skills. If you
want to know about my professional career, check out my [résumé](/data/resume.pdf).

Whenever you are interested, just send me a message to [`enrmarc@gmail.com`](mailto:enrmarc@gmail.com).
I use that handle in some other sites like [GitHub](http://github.com/enrmarc)
and [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/434171/enrique-marcos?tab=profile).
