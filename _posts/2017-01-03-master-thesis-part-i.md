Three months have passed since I [started again] and I have to say, it's been
fine. Everything is *new*, but some things haven't changed. Writing is still
hard as hell, even more in English, and it happens to be that I have to write
a 60-to-90-pages thesis for getting my master's degree.

About six months ago I decided to get better at writing. The plan always has
been "write at least something every week": a blog post online, a short
story nobody ever is going to read, w h a t e v e r.
Couldn't make it. And the reasons?

> There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got...

Anyway, since I *have to* write for real, it could be a good idea
to upload some of my work here and kill two birds with one ~~shot~~ stone.
I'll try to write something every now and then.
