I'm packing, and I need to get rid of a lot of things in the process. That
shirt I haven't used for years, gone. Oh, this jacket that no matter how
many times I wash it still smells like teen spirit, gone too.

Prepare to evacuate soul in ten, in nine, eight.

It's liberating. You should try.

Seven, six, five.

It's not only about clothes. Magazines, semi broken hangers, red pens, unused
cases, bitten wires.

Four.

40% of my possessions gone.

Death to commence in three, two.

Old phone numbers, browsing history, bank letters, my memories... this has gone too far.

Prepare for the last breath, now.

Soul clear.
