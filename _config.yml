biography:   "I am a Software Developer. My blog isn't read by millions of people, I haven't
             written a tool used by thousands neither have I worked for the Big 4.
             Although, I like what I do.
             Currently working on my M.Sc. Thesis (NLP and Learning Analytics)
             in the <a href='https://www.uni-due.de'>Universität Duisburg-Essen</a>.
             More information on my <a href='/data/resume.pdf'>Résumé</a>."
